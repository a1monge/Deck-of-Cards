# Deck of Cards - Project Description

## Project Overview

The **Deck of Cards** project is a simple, yet highly functional web application that simulates a deck of playing cards. It allows users to shuffle and draw cards from a deck, showcasing the use of randomization, UI components, and client-side interaction. This project demonstrates my skills in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with a focus on building a clean, user-friendly interface and implementing core functionality for card manipulation.

## Key Features
- **Card Deck Simulation:** Users can shuffle a deck of 52 playing cards, draw individual cards, and display them on the screen.
- **Shuffle and Draw Functions:** The application includes functions to shuffle the deck and draw a random card, simulating the real-life process of drawing cards from a shuffled deck.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The UI is designed for simplicity, with a focus on user interaction. The cards are visually represented using images, making it easy for users to see the drawn cards.
- **Interactive Elements:** The project includes buttons to trigger actions like shuffling the deck and drawing cards. The buttons are styled using modern CSS techniques and are responsive across different devices.
- **Built with Vanilla JavaScript:** The application uses vanilla JavaScript for functionality, highlighting my ability to work with the core language and create dynamic features without relying on external libraries.

## Technical Skills Utilized
- **HTML5:** For structuring the webpage and organizing content.
- **CSS3:** For styling the application and ensuring the UI is responsive and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the card deck logic, such as shuffling, drawing, and displaying cards. I also used JavaScript for handling DOM manipulation to dynamically update the interface.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices of all sizes.
